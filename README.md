You can improve your neural network's validation accuracy by using techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting, regularization (L1/L2) to constrain weights, and batch normalization for stable training. Additionally, tuning hyperparameters, increasing data (Data augmentation) technique , or using pre-trained embeddings (like Word2Vec) can enhance performance.
